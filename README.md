# Bonjour!

I don't code much in my role as a service designer but I was a software developer before and code a lot these days on a personal project to create a [**Digital Skill tool for the East Renfrewshire Council**](https://blog.chezleskrus.com/2020/05/06/improving-digital-skills-building-a-tool-with-the-govuk-prototype-kit/).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about it if you are interested.

I also volunteer for [**Code Your Future**](https://codeyourfuture.io/) - check them out, it's a great organsiation, teaching code to refugees and disadvantaged, maybe you can help too?
