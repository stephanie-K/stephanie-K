# Bonjour!

I don't code much in my role as a service designer but I was a software developer before. 
I've used Github pages for one of my past side-projects: [**Practioner Stories**](https://stephanie-k.github.io/practitioner-stories/)
I've used the GOVUK prototype kit to create a [**Digital Skill tool for the East Renfrewshire Council**](https://blog.chezleskrus.com/2020/08/01/improving-digital-skills-a-tool-using-the-gov-uk-prototype-kit-part-2/).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about it if you are interested.

I've also volunteered for [**Code Your Future**](https://codeyourfuture.io/) - check them out, it's a great organsiation, teaching code to refugees and disadvantaged people, maybe you can help too?
